Hi Team,

We have already:

Mounted the keytab into the AKS pod

Added the required egress rule for the on-prem SQL Server domain

As discussed, krb5.conf will be created/provided from your side.

To complete MVP testing, we need your help with one pending item:
🔸 Please update the application Dockerfile to install Kerberos client runtime libraries (Kerberos/GSSAPI).

Without these libraries, even with keytab and krb5.conf in place, the pod cannot complete Kerberos authentication to SQL Server.
