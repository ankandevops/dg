Yes, we can manually copy the keytab and create krb5.conf in the pod as a workaround to start testing — however that alone will not be sufficient to validate Kerberos / Integrated Authentication end-to-end.

Reason:
Kerberos authentication is not only configuration-based. Along with krb5.conf and the keytab, the container must also have the Kerberos/GSSAPI runtime libraries installed (e.g. libkrb5, gssapi libraries). These libraries are what the SQL client driver uses to actually perform Kerberos negotiation with the domain controller (KDC) and request tickets.

So:

✅ We can manually place krb5.conf and the keytab into the pod for quick testing

❌ But if the container image does not include Kerberos runtime libraries, the SQL client will still fail during authentication (it cannot use the keytab or communicate with KDC properly)
